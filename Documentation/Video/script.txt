Cattle are a vital part of the agricultural industry . As with any livestock, maintaining the health of cattle is essential to ensuring their well-being and productivity. One important aspect of cattle health management is monitoring their health status in real time. 

Youuu SENNSE aims to create innovation in livestock industry by providing a robust solution to the farmers which enables them to monitor their herd even from a remote location. Staying informed allows them to take timely and informed decisions.

=================================================


Equipped with State of The ART technology, the system provides farmers with information about Biological as well as the behavioral information of their cattle. Furthermore, it enables farmers to be aware of Potential threats to their cattle from the surrounding atmosphere.

====================================================
The wearable device makes use of IoT technology with embedded hardware and software system attached to the ear of Cattle. Each node connects to a wireless network and transmit their data to a database hosted on cloud server using Wide Area Network.


========================================================

The Mobile Application is designed with focus on USER Friendly Interface.

Each sensor node can be assigned a Unique Name.
The top Fields display the status of environment around the cattle.


The system Uses smart signal processing techniques to monitor the heart Rate in Beats Per minute scale.
Followed by body Temperature. The Farmers get to know the accurate body temperature of cattle which is very important in early disease detection.
The system can detect and warn sensor devices looses contact with Cattle body.

Use of smart motion tracking algorithms allow the device to monitor the behavior of cattle, specifically movement and grazing patterns which help in disease detection.
Moreover, The system is smart enough to detect if it is installed in the appropriate orientation to ensure accurate results.


===========================================================
The compact size of the system allows it to be installed on the Ear of cattle.
While featuring rechargeable lithium batteries, the system is designed to be highly power efficient in order to reduce the maintenance time.
Moreover, low costs per unit make it possible to use the system on both small and large scale farms.

==========================================================
In our testing, the system has proved to be comfortable for cattle.
